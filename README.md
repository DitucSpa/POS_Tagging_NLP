# POS_Tagging_NLP
Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging is the task of labelling each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech; in the last years, the majority of the researchers mainly used Deep Learning tools for developing POS tagging models, which includes neural network architectures. The two best models according to the macro F1 score are the BiLSTM followed by a Dense layer (BiLSTM model) and the twolayer BiLSTM followed by a Dense Layer (MLBiLSTM model), which both perform with an F1 score equal to 0.79.

In this folder you can find:
- jupyter notebook with the models (BiLSTM, ML-BiLSTM, BiGRU, BiDense);
- the PDF report of the work;
- the weights of the models that you can upload in the notebook.
